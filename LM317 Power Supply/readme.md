#**LM317 Power Supply with split supply**
Rev 1.3
---
This is a simple LM317 variable power supply with an extra circuit that creates a split supply to power opamps and stuff. It's *theoretically* capable of sourcing like 1 amp, but I haven't tested that yet. To generate the split supply I used a voltage divider and an Op Amp from Linear Technologies called LT1206 as a buffer. Here is the link of the article that explains how to generate split supplies with a Virtual Ground. [Virtual Ground Circuits](http://tangentsoft.net/elec/vgrounds.html)
